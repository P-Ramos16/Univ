    <h1>Welcome to DesignWorks Professional 5 for Windows!</h1>
    <p>Thanks for purchasing DesignWorks Professional for Windows with Digital Simulator!</p>
    <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: The Simulator Option is in a beta test state in this release.&nbsp;All documentation on the simulator option, in particular the new JavaScript features relating to simulation have not been completed.&nbsp;This will be supplied to you at no charge as they are available.</b></p>
    <p>This note will point you to the resources and information available for registered users of the package.</p>
    <p><a href="./DesignWorks Users Guide.pdf">DesignWorks User&#39;s Guide</a> - This manual will be your primary reference on program operation.&nbsp;If you purchased the package without printed documentation, the manual is provided in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format in the Documentation folder in the DesignWorks program folder for online reference.&nbsp;Start by running through Chapter 3 - Tutorial to get a good feel for general operation.</p>
    <p><a href="./DesignWorks Simulator Users Guide.pdf">DesignWorks Simulator User&#39;s Guide</a> - This is your guide to the usage of the digital simulation features of DesignWorks.&nbsp;This manual is provided only in PDF format.&nbsp;If you are new to the DesignWorks Digital Simulator we recommend running through the tutorial sections in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 to familiarize yourself with the package.</p>
    <p><a href="./DesignWorks Export Script Language.pdf">DesignWorks Export Script Language Manual</a> - This manual is provided for those that wish to write their own netlist and report scripts, or to customize one of the scripts provided with the package.</p>
    <p><a href="./JavaScript Docs/JavaScript User's Guide/index.html">DesignWorks JavaScript User&#8217;s Guide</a> - This manual is provided to allow you get create your own scripts to add functions to the package.&nbsp;These can range from simple groupings of existing commands for convenience to major new applications.</p>
    <h2>Users-Only Web Site</h2>
    <p>Additional symbol libraries, technical info and free program updates are available to registered users at our special users-only site at <a href="http://www.dwpro.com">www.dwpro.com</a>.&nbsp;You will need your DesignWorks access code (15 letters and numbers) to enter the site or you can use the commands in the Help menu to enter directly.</p>
    <h2>Tech Support by Phone or Email</h2>
    <p>Feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:tech@capilano.com">tech@capilano.com</a> or at 604-522-6200 or 800-444-9064 if you need any assistance with design editing, netlist generation or any other aspect of program operation.</p>
    <h2>Getting Adobe Acrobat Reader for Free</h2>
    <p>The main DesignWorks manuals are included with this release in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format.&nbsp;If you received DesignWorks on CD, then an Acrobat Reader installer is included on the CD.&nbsp;If you downloaded the DesignWorks files, then you can obtain Acrobat Reader for free directly from the Adobe web site.&nbsp;As of this writing, you can go to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Acrobat Reader page</a> directly, or, if that doesn&#8217;t work, just try <a href="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a> </p>
    <h2>Access Codes</h2>
    <p>You will need a separate access code to run the Simulator option.&nbsp;This means you will have to have your base version 5 access code (15 letters and numbers) that you got with the product plus a second code for the simulator option.&nbsp;These two codes need to be entered one per line in the Register box in the program.&nbsp;You may need to restart the program after entering the codes to get it to load the new modules.</p>
    <h2>To Remove the Simulator Option</h2>
    <p>You can remove the simulator option by using the Remove icon that the installer places in the DesignWorks Professional submenu in the Start menu, then reinstall the schematic package from a regular installer.</p>
    <p>To manually remove the simulator code files you can do the following:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>delete all files from the Tools folder in the DesignWorks program folder</li>
     <li>reinstall DesignWorks Professional from a non-simulator version installer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>File Formats</h2>
    <p>The file format for design files (.CCT) has been updated to accommodate the new graphic drawing tools.&nbsp;Files created or modified in version 5 will <b>not</b> be readable by older versions.</p>
    <p>The library file format (.CLF) has not changed.</p>
    <h2>Installing and Opening Symbol Libraries</h2>
    <p>DesignWorks comes with a variety of different symbol library files and many more can be downloaded from our web site.&nbsp;By default, only a small number of these are opened automatically at startup. You can open and close libraries manually or customize which libraries open automatically when the program is started, to suit your application.</p>
    <p>NOTE: DesignWorks symbol library files normally have the &quot;.CLF&quot; file name extension.</p>
    <h3>Location of Libraries</h3>
    <p>When DesignWorks is first installed, the libraries will be located in the Libs folder inside the DesignWorks program folder.&nbsp;Inside that folder may be other sub-folders containing additional families of libraries.</p>
    <h3>Opening Libraries Manually</h3>
    <p>To open library files manually, right click in the parts palette window, or move to the Libraries submenu of the File menu, and select the Open Lib command.&nbsp;This command allows you to locate a symbol library file in the usual way.&nbsp;When the file is opened, it will be added to the list of available libraries in the parts palette.</p>
    <h3>Opening Libraries Automatically at Startup</h3>
    <p>When you use the Open Lib command described above, you can check the box &#8220;Open automatically at startup&#8221; to add this library to a list to be opened each time the program starts. To manage this list, you can use the Auto Open Libs command.</p>
    <p>If you wish to create a more sophisticated layout of folders containing libraries for your projects, you can use the LIBRARY and LIBRARYFOLDER keywords in the DesignWorks initialization file (DW.INI) to create additional library folders. For more information, look up the LibraryFolder keyword in the index of the DesignWorks manual.</p>
    <h2>Removing Custom Menus</h2>
    <p>The package comes pre-configured with a custom menu that demonstrates the scripting and customization features.&nbsp;To remove this or any existing custom menu, open the DW.INI file using Notepad, and look for any lines starting with &quot;menu =&quot; (keywords are not case sensitive, so it could be &quot;Menu&quot; or &quot;MENU&quot;).&nbsp;Comment these lines out by inserting &quot;//&quot; in front of them.</p>
