For simplicity, this website is divided between 3 main parts + 2 extra pages.

The extra pages are:
    -"Index" page
    -"About" page


The website is divided in:
    -"Drivers"
    -"Constructors"
    -"Circuits" (also integrates races)

All .html files are on the same folder (due to js sessionStorage limitations) but their 
corresponding .js file as well as thier images are in corresponding folders.
Each of these 3 parts have a "hub" page where we can enter their subpages.

Subpages:
    -"Standings"
    -"All"
    -"Details"

"Standings" means only the current season's details appear (2020), 
for example, driversStandings only shows the drivers of 2020.

"All" means every single driver, team and circuit appear on the page, for
example, driversAll shows every driver in the database, regardless of whether
he competed or not in 2020.

"Details" shows only the information of a particular driver/constructor/circuit/race.
